# Miss-u-Machine


I built two ESP8266’s with a matrix LED screen, that connects to Wifi and CloudMQTT. Whenever a button get pushed on a device, a little heart lights up on the other one’s screen for about 5 seconds. 

In our end we connected it through Home Assistant to get push notifications on devices.

Nothing too fancy, but it does something good.
